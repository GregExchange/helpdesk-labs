# Lab 07 – Performance Troubleshooting (System Slow)

## Scenario
User reported the Windows 11 system was running slow.

## Objective
Identify performance bottlenecks and apply safe troubleshooting steps to improve system responsiveness.

## Environment
- OS: Windows 11 Home
- Tools Used: Task Manager, Startup Apps, Storage Settings, Windows Security

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verified user complaint by observing system slowdown with multiple apps running
